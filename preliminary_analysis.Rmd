```{r}
# load some data from my other project for now. I'll copy my text cleaning routines and stuff in later. I should actually make them into a package sometime so I can just load them...
load("~/Work/UW/Code/GIT/cl_lda/archive/8_31_data.RData")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
